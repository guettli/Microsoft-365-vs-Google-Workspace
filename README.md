# Microsoft 365 vs Google Workspace 

January 2020 until September 2021 I used Google Workspace (aka GSuite).

Since September 2021 I use Office 365, since my new employer uses it.

To make it short: I am not happy with Microsoft Office 365.

I list here some notes.

Background: My major goal for an online office suite is to be able to take some nicely formated notes. And from time to time I need a simple spreadsheet. Nothing fancy. I hardly print documents, and if I do so, it is only for me. The formatting does not need to be perfect. Ease of use is much more important for me.

# Where Google is better

In o365 I click on "OneDrive", then the URL is "sharepoint.com". If I click on "Excel" the URL is "office.com". Not a big problem. But that's not nice.

In o365 (Word) I write "related_name ..." and Word thinks it is super smart and changes this to "Related_name". No, I don't want this smartness. I want this word to be lower-case.

In o365 (Word) the opions to change the font is easy to see. This has the draw-back that is less likely that I will use the right way: Define a line as "heading" or "title". I prefer to change the meaning of a text (like "Heading 1").

In Google Drive recently used files are visible at the top. I like this.

In o365 (OneDrive) when I am looking at the list of recently used files, then I am not able to add a new file.

In o365 (Word) opening a hyperlink is less intuitive. In Google Workspace I get a small popup window showing me two options: edit the link, open the link.

In o365 (general) there are much more lines and characters on the screen compared to the corresponding screens in Google Workspace. I think Google had one big goal: Reduce cognitive load. I think Microsoft had a different goal. Maybe "Make all features of our native desktop applications avaiable via the browser". But my background is different. I don't need all these features which the desktop version of MS-Word has.

In o365 (Word) the screen is flickering during the first seconds. The [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls-web-tooling/) could be improved.

Office 365 is usable, but if I could choose, I would use the easier to use solution from Google.

In o365: I am looking at an appointment which is linked to a video-call. I click the link, and get an annoying popup which asks me if I want to open the video call in the browser or in the native GUI. I prefer the google way: web browser only.

In "Word for web" I found no way to disable the spell checking. My doc contained a lot of strings which are in no dictionary. I wanted to disable all these red lines. Even my favorite search engine did not help. With Google Docs, that's easy. I found the way to disable it immediately.

In o365: I created a word document, but then realized that I don't need this. I want to delete the file. I don't find an option to delete the file.

In o365 VideoCall: I am in a Teams videocall. I want to invite someone. I copy+paste my URL. But this does not work. You need to go to the people-icon and then create a hyperlink for sharing. Grrrr. Copy+Pasting the URL of a Google Meet videocall works fine.

In o365 I see file extensions like ".docx". This looks ugly, and provides no benefit, since the icon already signals that this is a word document.

In Google Meet videocalls I can blur my background. This does not work for me (Ubuntu Linux) in o365.

## Calendar

In Google Calendar I see the HOUR:MINUTE an appointment starts. I like this.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/414336/145541079-501e13fd-1ced-4a9e-80cb-b7f27048d934.png)


In o365 I don't see this. I use the view where I can see monday-sunday. The time is visible left to the column of monday. This means it is hard to see the exact time on entries which are at the end of the week:

# Where Microsoft is better

Microsoft is better at reading/writing their docx format. But I don't need this feature.
